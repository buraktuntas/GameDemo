2. Run multiple BO3 matches
3. Collect feedback
4. Iterate on balance (edit `GameConstants.cs`)
5. Polish visuals and VFX
6. Add SFX and music

---

**Estimated Time:**
- Phases 1-3: 1-2 hours (setup)
- Phases 4-8: 3-4 hours (prefab creation)
- Phases 9-10: 2-3 hours (scene and configuration)
- Phases 11-12: 1-2 hours (testing)

**Total: 7-11 hours** (for someone familiar with Unity)
